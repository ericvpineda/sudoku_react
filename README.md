Working on: 
- implement buttons 
    - new, mode, solve, 
    - hint, erase
- implement num buttons
- implement cell highlight + arrow key input 
- modal overlay once successfuly complete
- implement time + persistence 
- add title + fix styling
    - board higher than control buttons + num pad 
    - make control btn + num pad more transparent
    - make cell numbers larger 
    - style buttons  
- add public readme.me with summary   

Completed:
- set up files and basic UI 
- complete sudoku solver fxn
- implemented react-hook-mousetrap for keypad input 
- implement mutable vs non-mutable cells

Issues:
- Control buttons shift below when page shinks small enough

Solved:
- how to select cells with background color
    - create selectedCell property in cellSlice and use ternary statement with styles to highlight background

Future Ideas:
- Create settings page (left-hand)
- Have tests for utilites and other fxns
- navbar? 
- Leaderboard based on difficulty
- solver fxn visual
- add more randomness to board creation
- make n x n grid 

Nice things to have: 
- bash file with simplified git commands
